# E-Commerce Website

This is a fully responsive, multi-page e-commerce website template built using only HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap 5 framework. The project was created to demonstrate a clean, modern, and user-friendly online shopping experience.

The website features several key pages:
* A dynamic **Homepage** with a carousel, product showcases, and informational sections.
* A **Shop Page** with product filtering and a search bar.
* A detailed **Product Information Page**.
* A functional **Shopping Cart Page** to review selected items.

## Technologies Used
This project is built exclusively with front-end technologies:
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Bootstrap 5**
